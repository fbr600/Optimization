This repository contain implementations for several optimization problems solved with graphs thecniques:

* A Star minimal path method
* Genetic Algorithm to solve the classical Travel Sales Problem

This are Assignments from *Optimization* at *Master's degree in Modelling for Science and Engineering* (2014)
